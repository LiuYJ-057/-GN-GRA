# GN-GRA
Codes of Predictive Capability Reveals Critical Friction in Granular Flows\\

The ‘Granular Flow Simulation’ folder contains example files for different granular ratios and friction coefficients via lammps. The folder ‘Granular Flow Simulation’ contains the in file for the granular flow simulation, the sorting and statistics file for processing the simulation results funnel_xyz, and the script file test.sh for batch simulation.
The ‘GN_code’ folder contains py files related to data processing, training, testing, and prediction for Graph Network simulation of GN-GAR.\\

The ‘miu=0.0001, miu=0.1, miu=0.2, miu=0.3, miu=0.4’ folder contains some of the pickle data that have been processed by to_newpickle.py for Graph Network training, validation, and prediction.\\

The ‘chain.nb’ file is the code for drawing the force chain in the granular flow image, which can be realised by Wolfram Mathematica, and the thickness of the chain is proportional to the magnitude of the force between the granules.
